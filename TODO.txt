Generators.
* Add the `BorrowRef[T]` and `BorrowMut[T]` types & code generation.
* Change GenRef[Yield, Send] to be &(Yield or GenFinished)
* Change GenMut[Yield, Send] to be &mut (Yield or GenFinished)
* Change GenMov[Yield, Send] to be (Yield or GenFinished)

Iterative loops.
* Work with the new generator types.

Encapsulation annotations.
* Add support for method encapsulation (methods map to attributes with $Type right now).
* Overriding functions must keep the same encapsulation level.

Generic types.
* Passing too many generic arguments causes a Python error.

Specialization.
* `sup std::Vec[std::Str]` applies to all `std::Vec` types.
* Generic arguments must match their parameters exactly for sup Type[T=T] to work (generic type regeneration)

Function folding.
- Binary and regular function folding.
